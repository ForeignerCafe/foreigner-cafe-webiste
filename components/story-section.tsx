              Foreigner Cafe began as a dream to create a space where community
              and craft coffee intersect. Our industrial-modern aesthetic was
              inspired by art, it's rooted by Founder and Director, Emily Chen's
              cherished Sunday afternoons with his Nonna's cooking food to
              nourish and bring delicious food. Here, you can taste world-class
              coffee and food in a space that feels like home.
